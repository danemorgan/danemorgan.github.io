I'm working on getting going with git and github. I really have to stop cowboy coding and start doing_it_right().

So I saw an article about using [GitHub Pages][github-pages] to build a blog that you actually update by pushing the posts through git.

Off to the races! Oh yeah!

Doing that will really immerse me in this thing and i'll definity sort out how it works like that, right?

Right. What could go wrong?

So... I'm a Windows guy. I don't hate Macs, but I have a libertarian bent and the weight of the Applement is an oppressive looking yoke to me. 

I like to go comando and piss in the wind. Life is messy. That's why God invented wet wipes.

So, of course, now if i'm going to do this I'm going to have to tweak some things. I have Python installed already, but, yeah, only to try to get 
some old GIMP plugins working. I haven't used GIMP in ages and it's only laziness that Python is still there. I've never done anything with it.
 
I do not, however, have Ruby installed.

I've thought about it. A number of times.

I'll see some cool toy and what to try it and then... Oh, it's Ruby.

Can you even install ruby on windows?

Crap.

Okay, well here we go.

Eight hours latter i'm typing this post into my GitHub pages blog.

I use the term loosely.

But, hey it's a start. Tomorrow i may find some time to make it a bit more useable. but for now, i have published a blog post through git. I'm a little pround of that.
